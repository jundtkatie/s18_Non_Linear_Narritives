What does it mean to occupy the internet? How does the role of designer change when we treat digital experiences like physical ones? This is an advanced interaction major elective exploring the experiential and occupiable nature of the internet. Through studio projects, classroom discussions, exercises, and field-trips (hopefully) students will explore the theoretical premise that defines the physical reality of internet, investigate the structural hierarchy of how it works, and tease out new ways of developing/working with databases and complex content. Work in this course could be browser-based but may also have physical components including artifacts, books, and exhibitions.
